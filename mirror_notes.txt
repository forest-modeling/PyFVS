Fix-Up a Broken SVN Branch

Sometimes a branch is not rebase-able. This seems to happen with FMSCrelease.
The reason is not entirely clear. I think the SVN branch is simply deleted 
and re-copied. Presumably it is copied from trunk, however there may be other
changes to prepare the release. In any case the branch history is broken and 
Git-SVN is unable to reconcile the commits.

The only solution appears to be to delete and re-fetch the broken branch.
Delete the branch locally and push the delete to the remote repository.
> git branch -d FMSCrelease
> git push origin --delete FMSCrelease

Fetch all the SVN commits for the configured branches.
A shallow fetch will complete quicker, but compromise some history.
Network errors cause this to fail on long fetches. The batch file 
`svn_fetch.bat` will call this repeatedly until it finishes completely.

> git svn fetch -r2500:HEAD

Now recreate the branch locally and push it to the remote.

> git checkout -b FMSCrelease
> git reset --hard remotes/open-fvs/FMSCrelease
> git push --set-upstream origin FMSCrelease

Now it should be ready again for integration

> git svn rebase
