Variants affected: SN

Description: 


1) SN variant: Modified the VOLUME and BFVOLUME keyword echo to state "CAN NOT
               MODIFY TOP DIAMETER, IT WILL BE SET TO DEFAULT VALUE" regardless
               of the value for top diameter in the keyword field.
   
2) ALL variants: The before-thin basal-area-weighted average stand diameter Event
                 Monitor variable (BDBHwtBA) and its after-thin equivalent (ADBHwtBA)
                 aid accuracy assessments of the Forest Service's Integrated Forest
                 Resource Management System (INFORMS) application. It is designed
                 to estimate the average DBH of the overstory trees before thinning.
                 The proportion of the stand considered stockable was being applied
                 twice in the calculation of these variables. To correct the calculation,
                 division by the proportion of the stand considered stockable was removed.

3) ALL variants: Slight variances in Forest type calculations were possible because of
                 varible initialization problems. This has been corrected.

Impact on users: The BDBHwtBA and ADBHwtBA EM variables were corrected.
