Variants affected: LS

Description:

LS variant: All of the National Forests in the Lake States variant
            were using the Gross Scribner Board Foot volume calculation
            method. This was changed so that the Chequamegon, Chippewa,
            Nicolet, Ottawa, Superior, Hiawatha, and Chequamegon-Nicolet
            National Forests use the Gross Scribner Board Foot volume
            method and all other National Forests use the International
            1/4 inch rule.

Impact on users: Users of the Lake States variant should get new executables.
