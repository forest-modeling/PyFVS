! FVS WC variant uses the Curtis 1974 SI curves for DF
!   Curtis 1974 uses an index age of 100 years
!   A height of 89' at age 50 translates to a Curtis site index of 147'
!   There are other ways to convert between SI curves

! This is subject to change based on recent research
! Additionally, the recent revisions to the FVS mortality
