C
C     READ A VARIABLE FROM THE DIRECT ACCESS RECORD BUFFER.
C
C     PART OF THE PARALLEL PROCESSING EXTENSION OF PROGNOSIS SYSTEM.
C
C        BUFFER - A SINGLE DIMENSIONAL WORK ARRAY USED AS A PRINT
C                 BUFFER.
C        IPNT   - POINTER TO THE CURRENT WORD IN THE BUFFER.
C                 WHEN READING THE FIRST RECORD IN A SERIES,
C                 IPNT IS SET TO THE END OF THE BUFFER IN ORDER
C                 BE RESET TO ZERO ON THE FIRST READ.
C        ILIMIT - END OF BUFFER.  MAX NUMBER OF WORDS WHICH CAN
C                 BE STORED IN BUFFER.
C        VARBLE - THE ARRAY WHICH IS READ FROM BUFFER.
C        ILEN   - THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN VARBLE.
C        IBEGIN - SIGNAL DESCRIBING WHETHER WE ARE BEGINNING A
C                 SERIES OF CALLS TO BFREAD, IN THE MIDDLE OF A
C                 SERIES OF CALLS, OR AT THE END OF A SERIES OF CALLS.
C                 1 - THIS IS THE FIRST CALL IN A GROUP TO BFREAD.
C                     THE BUFFER COUNTER IS SET FULL, SO WE WILL
C                     BEGIN READING FROM A NEW RECORD.
C                 2 - THIS IS A MIDDLE CALL TO BFREAD.
C                 3 - THIS IS THE LAST CALL TO BFREAD.
