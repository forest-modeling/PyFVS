PyFVS - Python wrappers for Open-FVS.

The Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) growth and yield model developed by the
USDA Forest Service.  FVS includes a suite of regional variants, individually
calibrated to predict the growth and mortality of tree species within a defined
geographic area.  Refer to the FVS website for documentation and supported 
production software packages.  http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/

Open-FVS was established as an open source project to facilitate colaborative 
development and code distribution. The Open-FVS SVN repository contains both
the official code base as well as development and feature branches. The official
code base is maintained by staff at the Forest Management Service Center (FMSC).

PyFVS is being developed to provide a Pythonic interface to the FVS model. PyFVS
originated as a branch of the Open-FVS code base. Currently PyFVS exists in two
forms, as a branch contained in the Open-FVS SVN repository as well as a fork
hosted on GitHub.  The SVN branch supports simple wrapper libraries generated 
with F2PY. The GitHub fork is used for development and includes a number of 
modifications to enhance the FVS API. There is also a Python package being 
developed as a high level abstraction of the FVS libaray API. The GitHub fork is 
periodically integrated with the SVN repository and generally tracks the trunk
branch in SVN.

PyFVS is provided "as-is". There is no official support. Please submit bug 
reports, ideas, enhancement requests, etc. using GitHub issues.

If you would like to contribute to the effort please fork the repository on 
GitHub. Pull requests would gladly be considered.
